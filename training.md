    text: Working in a consultative manner, BRS Assured will create risk evaluation criteria that will address the specific areas of concern or the general working practices of an organisation.  May that risk be in the field of Health & Safety, Environment, Quality, Ethical Compliance or many other areas; the assessment criteria will ensure that all compliance requirements are captured, but more importantly, the answers to the concerns can be provided.
